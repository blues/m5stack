The m5note Arduino sketch for communicating with Blues Wireless Notecard.

This sketch allows you to control a Notecard mounted on a Notecarrier-A using [M5stack](https://m5stack.com/) via an M5Stack Grove cable.
This setup will allow you to configure Notecard and send Notes to [notehub.io](https://notehub.io).

Compiling this sketch requires you to first install the [note-arduino library](https://github.com/blues/note-arduino) in your Arduino IDE.
