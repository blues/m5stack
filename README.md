# [Blues Wireless][blues]

The m5note Arduino sketch for communicating with Blues Wireless Notecard.

This sketch allows you to control a Notecard mounted on a Notecarrier-A using the [M5stack][m5stack] development toolkit via a Grove cable.
This setup will allow you to configure Notecard and send Notes to [Notehub.io][notehub].

Compiling this sketch requires you to first install the [note-arduino library][note-arduino] in your Arduino IDE.
